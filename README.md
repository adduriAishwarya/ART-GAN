# ART-GAN
Advancing Generative Artistry with TensorFlow
• Engineered a GAN for portrait generation, employing TensorFlow for data handling and normalization 
• Implemented deep learning with concurrent training of Generator and Discriminator with adversarial processes 
• Defined critical GAN parameters, epochs, optimizers, cross-entropy loss and performed hyperparameter tuning
